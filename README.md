# VoronStartupMods
Repository common mods that people add to their first voron build

Commonly Voron advice is to "Build Stock" then Mod. The reason for this is because it is much easier to get support if you are following a known source and working from the same material.
Voron Discord is exceptionally helpful, but if you have a conversation that starts with "I need help with homing", and continues with "oh yeah that doesn't apply to me because I have this special mod or sensorless homing" you are doing to frustrate the people helping you.

Disclaimer: I can't cover every single possible mod and this list is clearly biased.

Obviously if this isn't your first build or isn't your first voron you likely don't need this information.

So here is a list of mods that you can do to your printer during your first build:

| Mod | Description | Recommendation | Frustration Level | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| Nevermore Micro | Activated carbon filter mounted in the chamber or under the bed. | Generally harmess, you may have a few questions on setup but it's about as easy as setting up the exhaust fan on a V2 | 1/10 | https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro |
| Klicky Probe | This replaces the standard Omron Inductive probe at the toolhead for Quad-Gantry Leveling/Z-Tilt and Bed Meshing. Your toolhead picks it up uses it, and puts it back. | Skip this, use the inductive probe, the setup is involved, there is macro work that needs to be done, this is best left for when you understand Klipper a bit and your inductive probe starts failing. | 5/10 | https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe |
| Beacon Probe | High speed eddy current probe that maps your entire bed with thick meshes. | No, just no, if you can't get a regular inductive probe to work, what makes you think you can do this? | 7/10 | https://github.com/beacon3d/beacon_klipper |
| Voron TAP | This replaces the toolhead X-Carriage, Inductive Probe, and Z-Endstop. Your nozzle is now the endstop, checkmate. | Tap is a mixed bag, on one hand it is super reliable if you set it up correctly, on the other you can get a dodgy cnc or printed kit and end up with an unreliable mess. It does reduce complexity since there is no z-endstop, no endstop offset, just 1 z-offset and off to the races. But also there is some macro work for nozzle temp safety and always the posibility of scraping up your bed on startup the first time (tip: remove the bed, tap can home on any surface). Once it's set up you hardly ever have to touch it. | 3/10 | https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap |
| Sensorless Homing | You can't get your endstops to work? Hall Effect crapped out? Don't need em! Just a bit of Klipper-fu and you can home your machine (X/Y only) with no micro switches! This isn't so much a mod as a mode of operation for your stepper if it can even be called that. It replaces your X/Y endstops, either pod, hall-effect pod, relocated X or Y microswitches, all of it. No you should not try to sensorless home your Z, it does not have enough precision to help and may make a hole in your bed on some printers. | I would not recommend this for a first build. On a V0 it is fairly harmless, but on a larger machine so much can go wrong. You need a small amount of Klipper knowledge to set it up, and the guide isn't terribly deep. Can it be done? yes, is it easy to get support for it? No. | 6/10 | https://mmone.github.io/klipper/Sensorless_Homing.html |
| CAN Bus | Setting up a toolhead board with CAN on your toolhead, another board in your electronics bay (or directly to your mcu if supported), and only running 4 wires to the toolhead. Nice! CAN is a cool upgrade for those who don't like cable chains and love chasing down baud rate mismatches. | I really don't recommend this mod for beginners. At best you get tons of errors, at worst you get something that doesn't work and no idea what question to ask when you need help. There is some linux config stuff you have to mess with, on a lot of CAN boards the JST connectors are super TINY and hard to crimp which can cause thermistor errors, it's attractive and may be a fun upgrade... later after you have a running printer that prints, you know when you wanna make it not do that for the sake of removing 2 cable chains. | 8/10 | https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/docs/CANBUS.md |
| Toolhead PCB | This cute little PCB comes standard in LDO kits and is pretty cheap to acquire, it makes wiring up a toolhead much easier. Another bonus on some kits it comes with a buddy board at the other end so the wires can be neatly managed and labeled. You only need to run 14 (or 16) wires to the toolhead to get going. | I would say this is actually recommended even if it isn't part of the stock build. It makes it easier to know what is being wired, the PCB is well labeled, you run much less wire through the chains and usually kits come with pre-made wire looms with the correct PTFE wires. Crimps are standard JST, and pretty big, worst that could happen is you set up your motor wires backwards and posting a picture of the klipper error on that someone will tell you how to fix it quickly. | 1/10 | https://github.com/hartk1213/Voron-Hardware-SBPCB/tree/master/Stealthburner_Toolhead_PCB |
| Caselights/Daylight Stick/LEDs for your Enclosure | Need more light, here's more light, run some neopixels down to your MCU, write a bit of klipper code, and your dad's bothers' name is Robert. | This is a pretty harmess mod, specially if you're using 5v LEDs or a Daylight/Disco Stick mod. Just solder on a few cables, run them down the extrusions plug them in following one of 100 youtube videos, update your config and that's about it. The worst that could happen is you wire it backwards and it doesn't work, or you pump 24v into 5v LEDs and it blows the lights up. Oh no wait the worst that could happen is you tell it has more lights than your PSU can handle and you blow up your MCU or PSU, make sure you get the 5v version, don't be cheap. If you're careful this isn't a terribly hard mod. | 3/10 | https://github.com/hartk1213/Voron-Hardware-SBPCB/tree/master/Daylight |
| CNC Parts | Want pretty metal parts for your printer? There's 2 kinds, cheap ones that make your life hell, expensive ones that make your wallet hurt. | It is not recommended to use cnc aluminum parts for your first build. They could have unrepairable defects that can make it hard or impossible to finish your build without replacements. Plastic is the way to go for your first build. You could get a good kit or spend a lot of money and be fine, or you could get a cheap kit and never be able to level your gantry/bed reliably; it's not worth it. | 7/10 | ? |
| Light weight/Carbon Fiber X-Beam | Looking for Speed? Power? Look I got nothing it's a lightweight extrusion replacement for your X. | Don't bother, it's expensive and won't do what you think it will. You can always put it in after you have a working printer and are comfortable with what it can do. Some of these use special hardware, can be easily destroyed with over-torquing, tons of potential problems you can cause yourself that will torpedo your project. | 4/10 | ? |
| Beefy Idlers / Z/AB Idler Replacements | These are nice-to-have upgrades to your printer that make dealing with Z idlers or AB idlers a bit more reliable. | Do you need this? No, does it look cool? Yes. Can't really recommend anything like this if it deviates from the standard bom because you won't have parts for it. If you have parts and the instructions seems straightforward to you, go for it, generally harmless. | 2/10 | https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI |
| Tophat Mods for V2 | Want to make your V2 taller? Give you back those lost mm from a big toolhead, this is the mod for that. | I would not recommend this as part of your first build since it involves days of printing. But if you got a spare printer and don't mind the amount of time and filament, then this guide is likely not for you! Big parts, lots of warp. | 3/10 | ? |
| Chamber Thermistor | Wanna know how warm it is in your chamber? This is a pretty good way to do it. | Generally harmless. It's an easy mod with good payoff in the future. Some cable routing, some printer.cfg changes, it's up and running pretty easily. | 1/10 | https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#temperature-sensors |
| Camera | Slap a Web cam on your pi, stick it in your printer's face and now you can ignore your prints like you ignore your children. | Harmless, super easy to setup up. If anytyhing this is recommended. | 1/10 | ? |
| Bed fans | Easy way to get your chamber nice and warm and stay that way. They recruit useless hot air under the bed and give it a job warming up the rest of your chamber. Maybe not useful on a V0, or if you're printing PLA, but if you're using a Voron to print PLA I seriously question your life choices. | Bed fans are a way to augment airflow and temperatures in your chamber. Running the cables can be annoying but setup is very straightforward | 2/10 | https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Ellis/Bed_Fans |
| Crowsnest | More cameras than your printer has room for. This one is spicy, you want to add more than 1 camera to your printer, say you have a nozzle cam and a top cam? This is what you need. | Problem, there is a limit on how many cameras you can add depending on your setup, it is made up of a hodgepodge of code that works through arcane magicks when it wants to, lots of people have issues with this a non-standard setups like using CAN and nozzle cams or running klipper off a computer instead of a pi. Make it easier on yourself, don't try to set this up right on your first build before you've printed anything. | 9/10 | https://github.com/mainsail-crew/crowsnest |
| Nozzle Cam | Wanna watch your first layer go down and then stare into the screen as your printer flies back and forth spewing hot plastic? This is what you want. Warning: May make some people nauseated. | It's annoying to setup there's fiddly tiny cable bits, there's wires to run down the cable chains. I would avoid this on a first build. It's mostly just physically difficult to do, otherwise it's similar to a webcam. | 7/10 | https://github.com/3DO-EU/nozzle-camera |
| Exhaust Delete | Mods that remove the stock exhaust fan and replace it with a blank plate or magnetic plate that just lets the reverse bowden ptfe tube in. | I'd say it's a toss-up. If you're doing Nevermore, do this too because you won't need the exhaust. If anything the exhaust will make your chamber colder and draftier if you don't set it up correctly. And it looks nice. | 1/10 | ? |
| Extrusion Backers | Wanna strap more metal on to your gantry and reduce your mesh variance? Slap these on and off to the races! This is not useful on Switchwire, Trident or V0. | Generally harmless if installed correctly. The X backer has a few places where it could go for a correct installation. I don't think it's entirely necessary as a V2 mod, but everyone wants a 350x350 (eyeroll) printer so maybe it should be standard. | 1/10 | https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/whoppingpochard/extrusion_backers |
| ERCF/Tradrack/MMU | Want multiple colors in your prints? Add an MMU! | Don't. Just don't. Finish your damn printer before you start this project, MMUs are finnicky, wasteful and you'll spend more time chasing issues in configuration and screwing around with tolerances than actually printing. When it works it's awesome, but it takes a bit of time and a well tuned printer (see you need the printer first) to get it to work. And no you really can't print multiple materials with an MMU, you need a multi-tool setup for that. | 9/10 | https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject |
| IDEX/ToolChanger | Multiple tools, multiple temps and materials. That's about it. | It's complicated, there's no support, you should have just bought a Prusa XL, don't do this on your first build, you're wasting your time, you can't get your time back. | 10/10 | https://github.com/FrankenVoron/Tridex |
| Klippain | Free macros for all! (laughs in French) | Setup is okay, but it breaks up your macros into separate cfg files which can be frustrating to hunt and edit. Some people really enjoy it, I would rather someone learn to write their own macros before copying someone else's work. Many people end up uninstalling it eventually. | 3/10 | https://github.com/Frix-x/klippain |
| A Better Start Macro | Start Print Macros that will help you get off your slicer dependency. It's fairly solid and well recommended. | After your printer is printing, I would say this is a good first upgrade in terms of "software". Having good start and end macros is always a good idea, same for having solid Pause, Park, Resume, and Cancel macros that match your setup. | 1/10 | https://github.com/jontek2/A-better-print_start-macro |
| KlipperScreen/Touch Screen | Don't like the little screen with the encoder knob? Wish it had 100% more colors and touch? Klipperscreen is what you want. Get something like a BTT50, or bigger, the 5" is pretty average, works fine, 7" may be hard to find a mount for, the smaller one is just annoying. So many innuendo I just dodged. | Jury is out on this one. I think it's a really really useful mod to have, maybe even you first mod, because if you need to do anything to the printer and don't have a phone or PC nearby this is as good as either if not better. Requires a ribbon cable or HDMI cable that is the right length, a mount, some hardware. And it needs an install of Klipperscreen, which isn't too hard if you use KIAUH, but not everyone does, specially if you build off kits or locked down pi-alternatives. I installed it, never looked back, it's amazing. | 3/10 | https://github.com/KlipperScreen/KlipperScreen |
| Annex Tooless Latches | Need to hold up your panels? These latches don't need tape or hardware. | Harmless. You can print them out of PLA, or tape your panels on with painter's tape and try ABS. | 2/10 | https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/All_Printers/annex_dev-Panel_2020_Clips_and_Hinges |
| Snap Latches | Like tooless latches for your panels, but with 1 screw and some bits of filament. Excellent github explanation, but is mostly an easy thing to figure out. | I would say get these, but clearly I'm biased. They do make a very satisfying clunk when latching on. Can be printed in PLA but why not try ABS or ASA now that you've already printed the standard ones and they've disapointed you? They need a good first layer so tune that, and bits of filament to work, so don't use eSUN ABS+ unless you like frustration for some reason. | 2/10 | https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/richardjm/snap-latch-2020 |
| Monolithic Door | Satisfying magnetic clunk! When you want 1 big ass door instead of 2 flimsy half doors and a gap. | If you have the PC/Acrylic for it, go for it. | 1/10 | ? |
| 270 Degree Hinges | Doors get in the way, default doors can be a pain to print. You want some nice doors that swing all the way. You want 270 degree hinges. | You'll need callipers or a test print for these to make sure you got the right size. On an untuned printer they can be challenging. Turn up your fans. Get the drilled ones, skip the vhb, learn to drill acrylic, save yourself the hassle of droopy doors. I'm not biased, you're biased! | 3/10 | https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/chrisrgonzales/270_degree_hinge |
| Noctua A6x25 PWM fans for Electronics bay | Pair of slightly thicker, slightly browner, much much quieter fans for your electronics bay. | Harmless. This is an easy swap in, wiring may take a sec, but it's trivial. It makes a huge sound improvement | 1/10 | ? |
| Noctua fan for the Hotend | See how I didn't tell you which one? Because you shouldn't do this. | No, it doesn't blow enough air to keep your hotend's heatsink from melting down. Just don't, even if it worked for a bit it's just dangerous. | 11/10 | No |
| Filament Runout Sensor | It's just a microswitch that can tell if there is or isn't filament in the bowden tube. You can get Klipper to pause your print if you run out or do something special on insert/remove. | Simple mod, generally harmless if you don't dig too much into it and know what it's doing. I'd say it's a good safety measure to have in case you print small spools a lot | 1/10 | ? |
| Smart Filament Sensor/Encoder Filament Sensor | Like a Runout Sensor, but can detect clogs, spool tangles and runouts. BTT has a couple, but you can build your own with an encoder or binky encoder. Programming can be a bit more tedious but there is default code support in the Klipper base. | It's a common first mod/upgrade, also a common cause of inconsistent extrusion due to too much drag, or pause on first layers or slow printing due to bad configuration. It could save a print, I know it's saved a few of mine, but it could also be frustrating. | 4/10 | https://github.com/bigtreetech/smart-filament-detection-module |
| Colorful/Transpatent Bowden Tube | OOOOH Colors, OOOOH I can see what color filament I have inserted! | It's not PTFE, PTFE is milky white and cannot be dyed because it's teflon-based. It will cause drag issues and inconsistent extrusion after a while. It looks pretty, until it screws up your prints, seriously just avoid it. | 7/10 | No |
| Capricorn Tubing | It's tight, it's blue, it's super slick, it's Capricorn tubing! | You don't need it for your reverse bowden setup, and probably shouldn't use it for that, stick to the recommended stuff in the BOM. You 'can' use it for the extruder tube, it's fine. | 3/10 | ? |
| Rockers/Handlerbars | Gonna be working on your printer a lot, want something easy to help roll it over or carry it around? This may be the mod for you. | Harmless and easy to install. May not be useful on a smaller printer like a V0, but could be very useful on a large Trident or V2. Have no idea if it would be useful on a Switchwire, probably could use a handle on the top for swinging it around like a melee weapon. (Don't do that, you'll hurt your back) | 0/10 | https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/RockNLol/RockNRoll |
